A simple [BattleSnake AI](http://battlesnake.io) written in Python. 

Visit [battlesnake.io/readme](http://battlesnake.io/readme) for API documentation and instructions for running your AI.

This AI client uses the [bottle web framework](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html) to serve requests and the [gunicorn web server](http://gunicorn.org/) for running bottle on Heroku. Dependencies are listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).
